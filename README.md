State Machine Bug Designer
=================================

This project is a fork of Finite State Machine Designer, 
originally created by [Evan Wallace](https://github.com/evanw/fsm) 
and modified by [Nathan Otterness](https://github.com/yalue/fsm_designer).
It is aimed to provide a means to intuitively design bug patterns and export them in DOT format for
[State Machine Bug Finder](https://github.com/assist-project/state-machine-bug-finder/).
